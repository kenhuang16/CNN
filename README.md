# Computer Vision

## TrafficSignClassifier

In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was build to classify traffic signs.

For details, please check the [TrafficSignClassifier](./TrafficSignClassifier) folder.


## BehaviorCloning

In this project, a deep learning model which can drive the car automatially in a simulator was trained. There are three cameras (left, center and right) mounted in the car and they will take pictures when the car is running. The image data saw by the car were first fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN). After that, the well-trained model will be used to predict the steering angle of the car in the autonomous mode in the simulator to keep the car in the main road.

## LaneLineFinding&VehicleDetection

In this project, the lane lines and vehicles on the road in a video will be identified simutaneously.
