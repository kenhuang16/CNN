# Computer Vision

## TrafficSignClassifier

In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was build to classify traffic signs.

For details, please check the [TrafficSignClassifier](./TrafficSignClassifier) folder.


## BehaviorCloning

In this project, the motion of the car in the simulator will be cloned by convolutional neural network (CNN).

For details, please check the [BehaviorCloning](./BehaviorCloning) folder.

## LaneLineFinding&VehicleDetection

In this project, the lane lines and vehicles on the road in a video will be identified simutaneously.

For details, please check the [LaneLineFinding&VehicleDetection](./LaneLineFinding&VehicleDetection) folder.
