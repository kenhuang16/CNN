# Computer Vision

## TrafficSignClassifier

In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was build to classify traffic signs.

For details, please check the [TrafficSignClassifier](./TrafficSignClassifier) folder.


## BehaviorCloning

In this project, the motion of the car in the simulator will be cloned by convolutional neural network (CNN) - an implementation of ["End to end learning for self-driving cars"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316).

For details, please check the [BehaviorCloning](./BehaviorCloning) folder.

## LaneLineFinding&VehicleDetection

In this project, the lane lines and vehicles on the road in a video will be identified simutaneously.

For details, please check the [LaneLineFinding&VehicleDetection](./LaneLineFinding&VehicleDetection) folder.

## Rover

This is a project about mapping as well as sample collection and returning.

For details, please check the [Rover](./Rover) folder.
